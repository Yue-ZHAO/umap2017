## Abstract
Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) play an ever more central role in open education. However, in contrast to traditional classroom settings, many aspects of learner/user behavior in MOOCs are not well researched. In this work, we focus on modelling learner behavior in the context of continuous assessments with completion certificates, the most common assessment setup in MOOCs today. Here, learners can obtain a completion certificate once they obtain a required minimal score (typically somewhere between 50-70%) in continuous tests distributed through the duration of a MOOC.

In this setting, the course material or tests provided after "passing" do not contribute to earning the certificate, thus potentially affecting learner's behavior. Therefore, we explore how "passing" impacts MOOC learners: **do learners alter their behaviour after this point?** And if so how? While in traditional classroom-based learning the role of assessment and its influence on learning behaviour has been well-established, we are the first to provide answers to these questions in the context of MOOCs, providing valuable insights which can be used to design better courses in the future. As a result, we present a set of core behaviour patterns based on our extensive exploratory analysis of the log traces of more than 4,000 certificate-earning learners across four edX MOOCs.
